Live as if you only have today going to the gym Think what a better world it would be if we all  the whole world  had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap... Do not go where the path may lead  go instead where there is no path and leave a trail parade practice...worst time of the day He who strikes first  strikes twice. It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper anybody who wants to do stx lanes tonight report to delta barracks by 745...full battle rattle..this includes rucksack lbv with compass and water  dummy rifle  and redlines flashlight..have assault pack in rucksack bring kevlar and pc going to the gym...hit me up later Some people walk in the rain  others just get wet Anyone who can be replaced by a machine deserves to be may have overworked my abs today...feel torn The undertaking of a new action brings new strength going for a long run hit me up later Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard  there's the pain +AC0- and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know  lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well  I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body  it will respond The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it. The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it if you want to be a leader try and act like one There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing  the battle is half won  for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do. If I am not for myself  who will be for me? If I am not for others  what am I?And if not now  when? lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body +AC0- it just wears it out The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there. If I had to select one quality  one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success  whatever the field  I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end  to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying  ''Here comes number seventy+AC0-one+ACE- .if we wait for the moment when everything   absolutely everything is ready  we shall never begin getting smoked tonight I'm a great believer in luck  and I find the harder I work  the more I have of it. Your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience. You don't so much outrun your opponents as outlast and outsmart them  and the toughest opponent of all is the one inside your head going on a run monday..enough said Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius. I long to accomplish a great and noble task  but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble The average estimate themselves by what they do  the above average by what they are phones dead running the course  then to the weight room Personally  I don't think there's intelligent life on other planets. Why should other planets be any different from this one? Since the house is on fire let us warm ourselves going to the qm msc III class.. good day...goodnight got my battle rattle ready Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work. Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't. Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose+ACE- despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not+ADs- nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not+ADs- unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not+ADs- the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence  but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence  then  is not an act but a habit. I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom If life gives you lemons +AC0- make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it. Since light travels faster than sound   people appear bright until you hear them speak If you can't convince them  confuse them first free weekend The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it Far better it is to dare mighty things  to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure  than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat. Here's to you and here's to me  and I hope we never disagree. But  if that should ever be  to HELL with you  here's to ME Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words  so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing. It doesn't work to leap a twenty+AC0-foot canyon in two ten+AC0-foot jumps Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius finished ruck run I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best Sometimes                            it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge                            hammer chem test Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives I'm not the greatest+ADs- I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out  I pick the round. If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years  then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication  we often suffer from a shortage of listeners If the path less traveled were the easy path  then all would take it  thus making greatness simply average People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid No matter where you go  there you are There is no point at which you can say  Well  I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap just got back from rugby and the weight room  going to eat....hit me up later If                            you're in a fair fight  you didn't plan it properly Your             problem is that you think you have time Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels  it finds the darkness has always got there first  and is waiting for it. It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen Before you criticize someone  you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them  you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves. I can picture in my mind a world without war  a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world  because they'd never expect it Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you  chances are it will burn very briefly Surprise Me Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire. If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind  what is the significance of a clean desk? Believing requires action Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before Those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life  while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation Where am I? Thinking is more interesting than knowing  but less interesting than looking Man imposes his own limitations  don't set any We run  not because we think it is doing us good  but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become  the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say  'You must not run faster than this  or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule  equally arduous in actual and intellectual life  may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. Restlessness is dicontent  and discontent is the first neccesity of progress I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring. http:////www.youtube.com//watch?v+AD0-K78zNtO+AF8-EFQ+ACY-feature+AD0-PlayList+ACY-p+AD0-17708ED0C8CF48C1+ACY-index+AD0-19 the slower we move the faster we die One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us  feeling the world is unpredictable enough  try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives. There are four ways  and only four ways  in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do  how we look  what we say  and how we say it. Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable. Workouts are like brushing my teeth+ADs- I don't think about them  I just do them.  The decision has already been made Leadership is no more confined to process  than writing is to format Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity  more audacity  always audacity  his amazing success in life  war  and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have Everyone is trying to accomplish something big  not realizing that life is made up of little things not gonna sleep good tonight No bees  no honey+ADs- no work  no money. that was fun I hate the expression +ACIAIg-What makes him tick.+ACIAIg-  It is the American mind  looking for simple and singular solution  that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks  he also chimes and strikes the hour  falls and breaks and has to be put together again  and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard  fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep  fight one more round +//0A7//9AL7//QCW- remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten Earlier tonight  I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding What is opportunity to the man who can't use it? Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T)  the rest of the week says WTF? The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable  unhappy  or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments  propelled by our discomfort  that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers Read  every day  something no one else is reading. Think  everyday  something no one else is thinking. Do  every day  something no one else would be crazy enough to do. Someday There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed  sweat  and determine yourself for the things you want most is now. All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth. All change is not growth+ADs- as all movement is not forward. stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place. Dream Great...Achieve Greatness Our business in life is not to get ahead of others  but to get ahead of ourselves +AC0ALQ- to break our own records  to outstrip our yesterday by our today.
