Whatever it was I'ma try to take it easy today too.gonna stay late at work to get some extra stuff done, & then go home & veg out. I'm a geezer today, I guess...I mean to go to bed early (to get over the Plague of Atlanta), and yet I end up staying up all night doing practically nothing.  Story of my life.

Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh...Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face*Ok...there are piles of ""junk that isn't supposed to be on my desk"" that keep getting bigger...while the things that are supposed to live on my desk are magically disappearing.  What fresh hell is this?!The Mighty Boosh is completely mad but completely awesome. It has soothed my disgruntled sadness with its peculiar brand of British inanity...and interpretive dance. *nodnod*Today's sky is as grey as my default mood setting.

It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though...Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me ""Was machts du gerade"" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :PSoooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.

Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind.Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!!Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again!I just saw an...interesting...car commercial. According to said commercial, apparently ""Twilight's *PROPNAME*"" drives...a Volvo. A Volvo. A vampire...in a Volvo.* Wow...I didn't think that that character could get any lamer; I was wrong!  *No offense to Volvo owners, the cars are fine...but 'Mister (supposedly) SuperAwesome Vampire' driving one? LOL.is now friends with I NEED A FUCKING CAR!!!I gotta ask: why pirates OR ninjas?  Why not both?  Also, two interesting concepts I've recently discovered: Horror Cakes competition on Food Network tomorrow (one of them bleeds when you cut the cake! AWESOME!)...and a children's book series I saw in the bookstore recently, called Vampirates...I dig the name, and the concept...not sure about the execution though.  Still...intriguing!Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile*""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again.Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears.Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!!is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment!Happy Halloween all!

I'll probably be sorry I asked...)Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much.My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb.Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.

Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being!Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise!Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose!WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?

Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA!Meow?Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from.

Guess work doesn't agree with me!Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.

"New Year's resolutions... why wait until January? Screw that, December is MY month! I will exercise daily. I will not fall asleep randomly without brushing teeth (eww). I will clean my room weekly. I will not save files with names like 'adsvdsq.' I will finish all tasks by 75% of the deadline. And for motivation, I will move $100 from my checking to my savings account each time I fail! Go go self-improvement!Baking in my room. TTYay! Left my flash drive inside a computer in a PACKED math lab yesterday. Called the office today and asked them to check and it was still there! Now I can go back to sleep; woke up early to call them before anyone found it. ZzzzYou know in Spiderman where he wakes up, puts on his glasses and realizes he doesn't need them anymore? Yeah, I had that today then I realized I had my contacts on. -.-I just had a dream that combined The Grudge + Twilight + Harry Potter + Pokemon.

"Just remembered, I seen a naked guy running up the supports on the squinty bridge last night with all hanging out .. but wearing socks. Not a pretty sight.Seen a leaflet guy coming into building. so i collected together all the leaflets we have (about 15-20) and when he went to post the leaflets I posted them all outwards as he opened the letterbox. He looked a little confused and tried to push them back, so I posted them back out again. Ahh its fun to piss off people.Feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least I think its not!)Got a pair of degu's last night, already causing issues!

If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respondThe person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate itif you want to be a leader try and act like oneThere is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do.If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when?lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it outThe first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they areYou don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there.If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!.if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begingetting smoked tonightI'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.Your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience.

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotentThe will to win means nothing without the will to prepareExcellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredomIf life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it.Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speakIf you can't convince them, confuse themfirst free weekendThe power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have itFar better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to MEJust because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changedAs it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing.It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumpsCommon sense is instinct.

It's simply that I just have toIt seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listenersIf the path less traveled were the easy path, then all would take it, thus making greatness simply averagePeople demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoidNo matter where you go, there you areThere is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now.

No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitableWhat I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.

America, fuck yeah!9//9.  Finally done.My 2005 *PROPNAME* has a ridiculously sharp throttle response.  I wonder if it has anything to do with the unintended acceleration problems...wonders why engineers are overrepresented in terrorist organizations.Mass Effect 2: It's nice to see that the Nigerian 419 scam is still going strong in 2184, this time with Batarians trying to recover quarantined Prothean artifacts.I don't know why new car dealers in Houston insist on all-season tires on all their products.  We have snow one day every 3 years!Note to 'The Wildlife Fund': Fuck you, stop pestering me about your $500 'donation' to my nonexistent 'zoo'.Dear BioWare: Dragon Age is a wonderful and entertaining game, but epic fail on the load times.  At least make the wait entertaining.
