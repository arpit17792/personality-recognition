Most of us don't even know what we're looking for. But we all feel it, that unexplainable emptiness that can only be filled by one thing." Then they pan to the stars and the answer appears.

Therefore, we have to borrow from the past and invite the future all the time. Maybe that's why we seek religion. Maybe that's why we march in the street. Maybe that's why we complain to society. Maybe that's why we vote for the presidents.can't sleep because the dog  keeps barking at something in the yard and its kinda freakin me outrediscovered an old journal and some old poetry of hers and is spending the day pondering who she is and who her real friends are                            ....... bed rest has given me A LOT of time to think lol *<:~)I find it interesting that I cannot reply to comments on *PROPNAME*'s page without entering my phone number.

Best newly discovered unhealthy snack disguised as a healthy one: yogurt-covered raisins  :DGoing through everyone's status messages from last night... yeah, so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:PWow, even in 1963, *PROPNAME* was ranting about the "half-wit morons up in Sacramento" (just watch It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World)Just to be clear: Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries.  :DAmadeus is quite possibly the most perfectly made movie *ever*...  director's cut bits add even more to the perfection.Ears are being blown out by two trombone players... sure, they're classically trained and playing Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War", but it HURTS.  :P32 days til the State Fair!  You better believe I have a count down going!!Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year???  What was at the OC county fair?  I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair...  ;)Devising ways to oust the old tenant out of *my* new place.  Not too happy that he's choosing to take another week to move out.  >:PThis hair-brainedness needs to cease... NOW.  :PMMmmmmmm Trader Joes tart frozen yogurt... makes a mouth VERY happeh!!  :DGoing to have to severely restrain my impulse to gallop around the State Fair, squealing at the top of my lungs with glee.  :DAlready sleepy time again...  I blame lunch from Bread Store.Missed the forest and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too.  :PNothing personal against you all as a species, ants, but mi casa es just not su casa.How did a non-coffee drinker like me end up hooked on cappuccinos?Okay Bears...

But in the spirit of the season, it shall be spared.First there was TIGER; then TIGGER; and now LUST.  The alphabet soup of federal bureaucrats never ceases to amuse me.  And how ironic LUST stands for so-not-sexy "Leaking Underground Storage Tanks".I'm not quite sure how I feel about having my singing voice compared to *PROPNAME* (especially when the boyfriend makes the comparison).Does it count as a new years resolutiion to resolve to watch every episode of a TV series?Cold weather, lack of sunshine and fog all breed pestilence... Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence (knock on wood), but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches.

And I wish you joy and happiness but above this I wish you love....And I "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouths speaks". Guard your words at all times. Your mouth can do so much damage to you and those around you. "The tongue is a world of iniquity, set afire of hell."Word of the day: You don't have to settle for anything or anyone in your life.

At a cognitive level, this implies that linkages exist in memory between significant-other representations and the self, as well as between knowledge designating social categories and the self."[ ?? ] ??MBA???????!?! ????! ????

I poop on you.I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms.1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fadMeh.Ok, *PROPNAME*.

I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (*PROPNAME*)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solidis stoked bc a big grocery store, a nice gym, and a pinkberry (best after workout carbs ever..) are all within 1 block of my penthouse in Ipanema.  Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heavenWhat a beautiful life... my family, my friends... amazing.

Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions.back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a realityI think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard.wow, I got d-r-u-n-k last night... hangover in full effect.  mike gets in today, and I think we are all going to the lake.

And youﾒd better get to living" - *PROPNAME*"To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father's has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association -- the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."~*PROPNAME*can't breathe out of either one of my "noses" (as my sister used to call them)well my first class was cancelled because the professor thinks her whole family has come down with H1N1, so I'm trying to be productive anyway....class, back to the apt. to pack, pickin' up a few necessities at Bass Pro, Dentist, then home for the weekend!! :)Also, Happy XXrd Birthday to my Mama!Oh my gee willikers----I do not like writing memos...So, just about everyone on my friend list is highly upset that it's Monday; but I know that once I get through this "9-6 in class + homework after that"  Monday, my week is nearly over...
